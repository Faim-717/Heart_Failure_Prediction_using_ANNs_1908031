# Heart_Failure_Prediction_using_ANNs_1908031

According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular
diseases (CVDs) account for around 17.9 million
deaths globally, claiming the lives of an estimated 17.9 million
people annually, or 32%of the global population. Early detection
and treatment of heart disease are getting more challenging due
to population growth. The development of machine learning (ML)
in the medical field has allowed us to create models that can forecast
heart conditions. The goal of this work is to develop a model
that, using these 11 clinical characteristics, can accurately predict
if a person has cardiovascular disease or not. For this study,
i used the UCI heart failure prediction dataset.For this study,
i used the UCI heart failure prediction dataset. In this research,
i have employed four distinct machine learning (ML) techniques
to create the model: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest
neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression .
Logistic Regression is the most appropriate machine learning
methodology, with 92.30 % accuracy in predicting whether a
person has a cardiovascular condition or not, according to
a comparison of all the aforementioned methods. A detailed
explanation of each algorithm is also included in the researchâ€™s
implementation section. Additionally, this predictive system will
help physicians reduce the number of deaths from heart disease.
